A small framework, aimed to accelerate development of physics puzzle games.  

Main feature is simplified level editing with use of [**Adobe Animate CC**](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html) (previously known as Flash IDE) and a set of adjustable components - physics primitives and joints. Those components, along with graphics, can be easily combined into complex game objects.

For usage example see the [**demo repo**](https://github.com/maxpostnikov/physics-puzzle-framework-demo).

##
Physics engine is [**Box2D**](http://www.box2dflash.org/).  
Tweening engine is [**GreenSock**](https://greensock.com/tweenlite-as).

This was made back in 2013 and was rarely in use since then. I can see now that it's kinda badly designed, and could be vastly improved. But this seems pointless since Flash is almost dead now. So I'll just leave it as is for history.
